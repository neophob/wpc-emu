# Run a 27 years old Pinball Machine in your browser

In this talk Michael will show you how to emulate a 27 years old Williams pinball machine
in your browser. He will demonstrate step by step how the emulator was build.

He will explain how to emulate the CPU, FPGA, a dot matrix controller and other hardware
in JavaScript and the underlying architecture of the emulator to provide tick accurate
timing.
His goal is to show that emulating a CPU is not black magic...

This talk also features a live demo of the Williams pinball emulator, including how to
visualise internal emulator state to help debugging.
